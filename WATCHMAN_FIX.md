# Watchman Installation - EMFILE Error Fix

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - Expo Metro bundler now runs successfully

---

## 🐛 **The Problem:**

```
Your macOS system limit does not allow enough watchers for Metro, install Watchman instead.
Error: EMFILE: too many open files, watch
```

This error prevented Expo from starting because macOS has a default limit on the number of file watchers, and React Native projects with many files exceed this limit.

---

## ✅ **Complete Solution Applied:**

### **1. Installed Watchman**
```bash
brew install watchman
```

**Watchman Version:** 2025.10.06.00

### **2. Increased File Descriptor Limit**
```bash
ulimit -n 65536
```

### **3. Verification**
```bash
watchman --version
# Output: 2025.10.06.00

curl -s http://localhost:8081/status
# Output: packager-status:running
```

## 🎯 **What Watchman Does:**

- **Efficient File Watching**: Replaces macOS default file watcher with a more efficient system
- **Handles Large Projects**: Can watch thousands of files without hitting system limits
- **Metro Integration**: Works seamlessly with React Native Metro bundler
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows
