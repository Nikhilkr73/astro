# Google Play Billing & APK Build - Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** November 1, 2024  
**Status:** Configuration Complete - Ready for Keystore Files & Build

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Package Name & App Configuration ✅
- ✅ Updated `app.json` package from `com.astrovoice.kundli.v2` → `com.astrovoice.kundli`
- ✅ Updated backend `google_play_billing.py` package name default
- ✅ Updated `env_example.txt` with correct package name

### Phase 2: Credentials Setup & Security ✅
- ✅ Created `credentials/` folder at project root
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude credentials folder and keystore files
- ✅ Created `credentials/README.md` with keystore documentation
- ✅ Added keystore credentials to `env_example.txt`

### Phase 3: Enable Google Play Billing ✅
- ✅ Installed `react-native-iap@^13.0.2` package
- ✅ Restored real Google Play billing implementation in `billingService.ts`
- ✅ Removed mock-only mode, added real IAP with test mode fallback
- ✅ All billing methods now use real `react-native-iap` APIs

### Phase 4: Android Signing Configuration ✅
- ✅ Created signing configuration in `android/app/build.gradle`
- ✅ Added release signing config with keystore path
- ✅ Configured automatic fallback if keystore not found
- ✅ Created `mobile/SIGNING_CONFIGURATION.md` guide
- ✅ Created `mobile/configure-signing.sh` helper script

### Phase 5: Prebuild Native Code ✅
- ✅ Ran `expo prebuild --platform android --clean`
- ✅ Generated `android/` directory with native code
- ✅ Verified `android/app/build.gradle` exists and is properly structured
- ✅ Package name confirmed as `com.astrovoice.kundli` in build.gradle

## ⏳ Pending Tasks (Require User Action)

### Required: Add Keystore Files
**Location:** Place in `credentials/` folder at project root

**Required files:**
1. `credentials/new_keystore.jks` - Signing keystore (alias: `kundli`, password: `kundli@123`)
2. `credentials/upload_certificate.pem` - Upload certificate from Google Play Console

**Verification command:**
```bash
# After placing files, verify certificate matches:
keytool -export -alias kundli -keystore credentials/new_keystore.jks -file /tmp/cert.pem
diff /tmp/cert.pem credentials/upload_certificate.pem
```

### Phase 6: Build Release AAB
**Status:** Ready to build once keystore files are added

**Build command:**
```bash
cd mobile/android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

**Output location:**
```
mobile/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

### Phase 7: Verification & Testing
- Verify package name in AAB matches `com.astrovoice.kundli`
- Verify signing certificate matches `upload_certificate.pem`
- Test AAB functionality on physical device
- Upload to Google Play Console (Internal Testing track first)

### Phase 8: Documentation
- All build documentation created
- Signing guide created
- Ready for final build verification notes

## 🔧 Current Configuration

### Package Name
- ✅ **App Package:** `com.astrovoice.kundli` (consistent across all files)
- ✅ **Backend Default:** `com.astrovoice.kundli`
- ✅ **Build.gradle:** `com.astrovoice.kundli`

### Signing Configuration

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Add Keystore Files** ⚠️ REQUIRED
   ```bash
   # Place files in credentials/ folder:
   cp /path/to/new_keystore.jks credentials/
   cp /path/to/upload_certificate.pem credentials/
   
   # Verify certificate matches:
   keytool -export -alias kundli -keystore credentials/new_keystore.jks -file /tmp/extracted.pem
   diff /tmp/extracted.pem credentials/upload_certificate.pem
   ```

2. **Build Release AAB**
   ```bash
   cd mobile/android
   ./gradlew clean
   ./gradlew bundleRelease
   ```

3. **Verify AAB**
   ```bash
   # Check AAB exists
   ls -lh app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
   
   # Verify package name (if bundletool available)
   bundletool validate --bundle=app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
   ```

4. **Upload to Google Play Console**
   - Go to Google Play Console → Your App
   - Release → Internal Testing (or Alpha/Beta)
   - Upload `app-release.aab`
   - Verify no signing key mismatch errors

---

## ⚠️ Critical Notes

1. **Signing Key Mismatch Prevention:**
   - ✅ Verify `upload_certificate.pem` matches keystore certificate BEFORE building
   - ✅ Once uploaded to Play Console, signing key cannot be changed
   - ✅ Test with Internal Testing track first

2. **Package Name:**
   - ✅ Must match exactly what's registered in Google Play Console
   - ✅ Currently set to `com.astrovoice.kundli` everywhere

3. **Keystore Security:**
   - ✅ All keystore files are git-ignored
   - ✅ Keep keystore files backed up securely
   - ✅ Never commit keystore files or passwords to git
