```bash
# Step 1: Build AAB for Play Console
cd mobile
eas build --profile production --platform android
# Wait ~20 min, download .aab file

# Step 2: Upload to Play Console
# Go to: Play Console ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Internal testing
# Click "Create new release"

# Wait ~15-30 min for "Available" status

# Step 3: Install from Play Store
