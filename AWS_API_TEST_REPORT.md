# AWS API Gateway Test Report

**Date:** $(date)  
**API URL:** https://4rdm6zfg0f.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod  
**Status:** Testing Required

## Test Results

### Critical Endpoints (Mobile App Dependencies)

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|
| `/health` | GET | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Basic health check |
| `/api/auth/send-otp` | POST | ⚠️ Needs Testing | **CRITICAL** - OTP sending |
| `/api/auth/verify-otp` | POST | ⚠️ Needs Testing | **CRITICAL** - OTP verification |
| `/api/users/register` | POST | ⚠️ Needs Testing | User registration |
| `/api/astrologers` | GET | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Astrologer list |
| `/api/chat/start` | POST | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Start chat session |
| `/api/wallet/{userId}` | GET | ⚠️ Needs Testing | Wallet balance |

## Issues Found

1. **"Missing Authentication Token" (403)** - API Gateway may not be deployed or endpoints not configured

## Next Steps

1. Verify CDK deployment: `cd infrastructure && cdk deploy`
2. Check API Gateway console for endpoint configuration
3. Verify Lambda functions are deployed
4. Test each endpoint individually
5. Check CloudWatch logs for errors

## Mobile App Impact

If AWS API Gateway is not functional:
- ❌ OTP will not work in production AAB
- ❌ User registration will fail
- ❌ Chat sessions cannot start
- ❌ Wallet operations will fail

**Recommendation:** Verify and deploy AWS infrastructure before publishing next AAB.
