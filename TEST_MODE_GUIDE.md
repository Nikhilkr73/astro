# 🧪 Test Mode for In-App Purchases - Complete Guide

**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Test the ENTIRE wallet flow in Expo Go WITHOUT building for physical device

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**You said:** "If I keep getting errors from you, it will require too much effort for me to test"

**Solution:** Mock purchase mode! Test everything in Expo Go, fix all bugs, THEN build for device once.

---

## ✨ What Test Mode Does

### In Expo Go (Test Mode ON):
- ✅ Select products → Works
- ✅ Tap "Continue" → Works
- ✅ Simulates Google Play purchase (1.5s delay)
- ✅ Calls backend verification API → Works
- ✅ Credits wallet with amount + bonuses → Works
- ✅ Shows success with bonus breakdown → Works
- ✅ Updates balance everywhere → Works
- ✅ Records transaction in database → Works
- ✅ Tests first-time ₹50 bonus → Works

### What's Mocked:
- ❌ Only Google Play billing API (no real charge)
- ✅ Everything else is 100% REAL!

---

## 🚀 How to Use Test Mode

### Step 1: Enable Test Mode (Already Done!)

**File:** `mobile/src/config/testMode.ts`

```typescript
export const TEST_MODE = {
  MOCK_PURCHASES: true,      // Enable mock purchases
  MOCK_PURCHASE_DELAY: 1500, // 1.5s delay (feels realistic)
  AUTO_SUCCEED: true,         // Always succeed (set false to test errors)
};
```

### Step 2: Test in Expo Go

```bash
# Start backend
python3 main_openai_realtime.py

# Start mobile app
cd mobile
npx expo start
```

### Step 3: Test Complete Flow

1. **Open Wallet Screen**
   - See "🧪 TEST MODE" badge (yellow)
   - Select ₹1 product
   - Tap "Continue (₹1)"

2. **Watch Console Logs**
   ```
   🧪 MOCK MODE: Simulating purchase for astro_recharge_1
   ✅ MOCK: Purchase successful
   🔍 Verifying Google Play purchase with backend...
   ✅ Purchase verified successfully
   ✅ Purchase complete! Credited: ₹51
   ```

3. **Verify Success**
   - Alert shows: "Recharge Successful! 🎉"
   - Bonus breakdown displayed
   - Balance updated immediately
   - Transaction in history

### Step 4: Test All Products

- ✅ ₹1 → Should get ₹51 (₹1 + ₹50 first-time bonus)
- ✅ ₹50 → Should get ₹50 (no product bonus, no first-time after first)
- ✅ ₹100 → Should get ₹110 (₹100 + 10% = ₹10 bonus)
- ✅ ₹200 → Should get ₹225 (₹200 + 12.5% = ₹25 bonus)
- ✅ ₹500 → Should get ₹575 (₹500 + 15% = ₹75 bonus)
- ✅ ₹1000 → Should get ₹1200 (₹1000 + 20% = ₹200 bonus)

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Test Mode Badge
When test mode is ON, you'll see a yellow badge:

```
┌──────────────────────────────┐
│ Recharge Amount  🧪 TEST MODE│
└──────────────────────────────┘
```

### Console Logs
All test mode operations are prefixed with 🧪:

```
🧪 MOCK MODE: Billing initialized (no real IAP)
🧪 MOCK MODE: Simulating purchase for astro_recharge_1
🧪 MOCK MODE: Purchase finalized (skipped actual finalization)
```

---

## 🧪 Advanced Testing

### Test Error Handling

**File:** `mobile/src/config/testMode.ts`
```typescript
export const TEST_MODE = {
  MOCK_PURCHASES: true,
  MOCK_PURCHASE_DELAY: 1500,
  AUTO_SUCCEED: false,  // ← Change to false
};
```

Now purchases will fail → Test error alerts!

### Test Different Delays

```typescript
MOCK_PURCHASE_DELAY: 3000,  // Slower (test loading states)
MOCK_PURCHASE_DELAY: 0,     // Instant (test race conditions)
```

### Test Backend Errors

Stop your backend server → Test network error handling!

---

## 🔄 Switch Between Test & Production

### For Testing (Expo Go):
**File:** `mobile/src/config/testMode.ts`
```typescript
MOCK_PURCHASES: true,  // ← Test mode ON
```

### For Production (EAS Build):
**File:** `mobile/src/config/testMode.ts`
```typescript
MOCK_PURCHASES: false,  // ← Real IAP
```

**Important:** Set to `false` before building for production!

## 🐛 Debugging

### If Purchase Fails:

**Check Console:**
```bash
# Look for these logs:
🧪 MOCK MODE: Simulating purchase for [product_id]
✅ MOCK: Purchase successful
🔍 Verifying Google Play purchase with backend...
```

**Common Issues:**

1. **Backend not running**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Network request failed
   Solution: Start backend with python3 main_openai_realtime.py
   ```

2. **Wrong product ID**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Product not found
   Solution: Check product IDs match billing.ts
   ```

3. **Database connection**
   ```
   ❌ Error: Failed to connect to database
   Solution: Check database is running
   ```
