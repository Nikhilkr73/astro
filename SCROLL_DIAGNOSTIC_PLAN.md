# 🔬 SCROLL DIAGNOSTIC TEST PLAN

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** 🧪 **TESTING IN PROGRESS**

---

## 🎯 **Test Objectives**

1. **Verify ScrollView is actually scrollable** with simple content
2. **Test auto-scroll functionality** when content changes
3. **Identify what's blocking scroll** in the chat screen
4. **Compare working vs non-working patterns**

---

## 🧪 **Test Components Created**

### **1. ScrollTest Component**
- Simple ScrollView with 20+ messages
- Test buttons to add messages and trigger scrolls
- Console logging for scroll events
- Fixed input area at bottom
- **Same structure as chat screen**

### **2. Test Steps**
1. **Load ScrollTest** - Navigate to chat session (now shows ScrollTest)
2. **Manual Scroll Test** - Try scrolling up/down manually
3. **Add Message Test** - Tap "Add Message" and see if auto-scroll works
4. **Scroll End Test** - Tap "Scroll End" button to test programmatic scroll
5. **Console Check** - Check browser console for scroll events
6. **Info Button** - Tap "Info" to see ScrollView state

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **If ScrollTest Works:**
- ✅ Manual scrolling should work
- ✅ Auto-scroll should work when adding messages
- ✅ Console should show scroll events
- ✅ **Issue is in ChatSessionScreen structure**

### **If ScrollTest Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ Manual scrolling blocked
- ❌ Auto-scroll not working
- ❌ **Issue is deeper (React Native/Expo setup)**

---

## 🔍 **Diagnostic Questions**

1. **Can you scroll the test messages manually?**
2. **Do you see console logs when scrolling?**
3. **Does "Add Message" trigger auto-scroll to bottom?**
4. **Do the test buttons work (Scroll End, Scroll Top)?**
5. **What does the "Info" button show?**

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps Based on Results**

### **If ScrollTest Works:**
- Compare ScrollTest structure with ChatSessionScreen
- Identify specific differences causing scroll failure
- Apply working pattern to chat screen

### **If ScrollTest Fails:**
- Check React Native ScrollView documentation
- Test with even simpler ScrollView
- Check for conflicting styles or components

---

**Please test the ScrollTest component and report:**
1. Can you scroll manually?
2. Does auto-scroll work?
3. What do the console logs show?
4. Do the test buttons work?

This will give us real data instead of guessing! 🔬
