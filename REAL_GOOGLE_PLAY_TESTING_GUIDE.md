```

---

### Phase 4: Build Mobile App for Testing (30-40 minutes)

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: You MUST Upload APK to Play Console First!

Google Play IAP only works with apps that are:
1. Uploaded to Play Console (Internal Testing track is fine)
2. Published to at least Internal Testing
3. Installed from Play Console (or via build)

#### Option 1: EAS Build + Upload (Recommended)

**Step 1: Configure EAS**
```bash
cd /Users/nikhil/workplace/voice_v1/mobile

# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# Login
eas login

# Configure
eas build:configure
```

**Step 2: Update app.json**

Add/verify these fields:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "AstroVoice",
    "slug": "astrovoice",
    "android": {
      "package": "com.astrovoice.app",
      "versionCode": 1,
      "permissions": [
        "com.android.vending.BILLING"
      ],
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "./assets/adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#FFFFFF"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Build APK/AAB**

```bash
# For Internal Testing (AAB - required for Play Console)
eas build --profile production --platform android

# Wait ~20 minutes for build
```

**Step 4: Download Build**
- Build completes ‚Üí You get download link
- Download the .aab file (Android App Bundle)

**Step 5: Upload to Play Console** ‚≠ê CRITICAL

1. **Go to Play Console**
   - URL: https://play.google.com/console/

2. **Navigate to Testing ‚Üí Internal testing**
   - Left menu ‚Üí **Testing** ‚Üí **Internal testing**
   - Click **Create new release**

3. **Upload AAB**
   - Click **Upload** 
   - Select your downloaded .aab file
   - Wait for upload to complete

4. **Fill Release Details**
   - Release name: "v1.0 - Wallet Testing"
   - Release notes: "Initial release with wallet and IAP"

5. **Add Testers**
   - Create test email list
   - Add your test account email
   - Save

6. **Review and Roll Out**
   - Click **Review release**
   - Click **Start rollout to Internal testing**
   - Confirm

7. **Wait for Processing** (~15-30 minutes)
   - Status changes to "Available"
   - You'll get an opt-in link

**Step 6: Install from Play Console**

1. **Open opt-in link on Android device**
   - You'll receive email with link
   - Or find in Play Console ‚Üí Internal testing

2. **Opt-in as tester**
   - Click "Become a tester"
   - Opens Google Play Store

3. **Install app from Play Store**
   - App appears in Play Store
   - Install normally
   - ‚úÖ Now IAP will work!

**Alternative: Install Development Build for Quick Testing**

After uploading AAB to Play Console, you can also install a development build for faster testing:

```bash
# Build development version (APK)
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Download APK
# Install on device directly
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Even with development build, you still need AAB uploaded to Play Console for IAP to work!

#### Option 2: Local Build

**Prerequisites:**
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured

**Build:**
```bash
cd /Users/nikhil/workplace/voice_v1/mobile
npx expo run:android
```

**Note:** Requires Android device connected via USB or emulator running

#### Test 1: First Purchase (‚Çπ1 Test Product)

**Steps:**
1. Open app on device
2. Navigate to Wallet screen
3. **Verify:** No "üß™ TEST MODE" badge (real IAP enabled)
4. Select ‚Çπ1 product
5. Tap "Continue (‚Çπ1)"
6. **Google Play dialog appears**
7. Select test account
8. Confirm purchase

  üéâ Bonus: ‚Çπ50
  ‚Ä¢ First-time bonus: ‚Çπ50
  
  Total credited: ‚Çπ51

Balance: ‚Çπ50 (default) + ‚Çπ51 = ‚Çπ101 total
```

**Check Backend Logs:**
```
üõí Purchase verification started
‚úÖ Google Play verification successful
‚úÖ First-time bonus applied: ‚Çπ50
‚úÖ Total credited: ‚Çπ51
‚úÖ New balance: ‚Çπ101
```

**Check Database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM wallets WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id';
-- balance should be 101.00

SELECT * FROM first_recharge_bonuses WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id';
-- should have one record

SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE user_id = 'your_user_id' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
-- should show ‚Çπ1 recharge with ‚Çπ50 bonus
```

---

  ‚Ä¢ Product bonus: ‚Çπ10
  
  Total credited: ‚Çπ110

Balance: ‚Çπ101 + ‚Çπ110 = ‚Çπ211 total
```

**Key Difference:**
- ‚ùå No first-time ‚Çπ50 bonus (already claimed)
- ‚úÖ Only product bonus (10% = ‚Çπ10)

---

#### Test 3: ‚Çπ200 Most Popular Product

**Expected:**
```
‚Çπ200 base + ‚Çπ25 bonus (12.5%) = ‚Çπ225 credited
New balance: ‚Çπ211 + ‚Çπ225 = ‚Çπ436
```

---

#### Test 4: Check Transaction History

2. Navigate to Wallet History screen

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Products Not Found

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Product not found: astro_recharge_1
```

**Solution:**
1. Wait 2-3 hours after creating products (Google Play propagation delay)
2. Verify product IDs match exactly
3. Check product status is "Active"

---

### Issue: Purchase Verification Failed

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Purchase verification failed: 403 Forbidden
```

**Solution:**
1. Check service account JSON path in .env
2. Verify service account has permissions in Play Console
3. Ensure Google Play Developer API is enabled
4. Restart backend after .env changes

---

### Issue: "This version of the application is not configured for billing"

**This is the most common error!**

**Solution:**
1. ‚úÖ Upload AAB to Play Console (Internal testing track is fine)
2. ‚úÖ Wait for "Available" status (~15-30 min after upload)
3. ‚úÖ Install app from Play Store (use tester opt-in link)
4. ‚ùå Direct APK install won't work for IAP!

**Why this happens:**
- Google Play IAP requires app to be "known" to Play Console
- Even test purchases need the app uploaded
- Internal testing track is sufficient (no need for production)

---

### Issue: Duplicate Purchase

**Error:**
```
‚ùå Purchase token already processed
```

**Solution:**
- This is expected behavior (prevents fraud)
- Make a new purchase to test
- Each purchase token can only be used once
